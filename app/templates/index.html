        {{ _('The convolutional neural network is a special architecture of artificial neural networks, proposed by Yan
        LeCun in 1988 and aimed at effective pattern recognition, is part of the technology of deep learning. The idea
        of ​​convolutional neural networks is the alternation of convolutional layers and pooling layers. The network
        structure is feedforward, essentially multi-layered. For training such a network, standard methods are used,
        most often the method of backpropagation. The activation function can be any, according to the choice of the
        researcher. The network architecture received its name because of the convolution operation, the essence of
        which is that each image fragment is multiplied by the convolution matrix (kernel) element by element, and the
        result is summed up and written to the similar position of the output image.') }}
